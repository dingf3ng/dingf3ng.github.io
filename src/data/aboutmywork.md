### Basic Coursework

I am a year 2 student at *School of Computing* in NUS. And I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics (almost finished), and Economics (not yet start).

### My academic focus

Currently I am exploring the possibilities in the field of Programming Language Theory, and their implications with *Formal Logic*. 


I am serving as a Teaching Assistant for *Discrete Mathematics (CS1231S)* and *Data Structures & Algorithms (CS2040S)* in School of Computing, NUS. From my observations, many students struggle to understand *why* they are learning these theoretical concepts, often dismissing them as *"nonsense"*. This lack of understanding is dangerous, as, in my opinion, the first and most crucial step in learning is **to know why** the subject is important and **what does it have to do** practical applications in ones future careers. The confusion often stems from a lack of interaction between courses like *Discrete Mathematics* and *Programming Methodology*, though they both have rather fitted syllabuses respectively.


Thankfully, there is hope for bridging this gap by introducing dependent typed languages or theorem provers into the current curriculum. This concept may help students grasp concepts like the *Curry-Howard Correspondence*, resolving their **"why-confusions"** and fostering a deeper appreciation for theoretical foundations. 


So for now, I am particularly interested in integrating advances in dependent typed languages into introductory courses to provide students with a more profound and beautiful understanding of programming. They deserve the **right to learn something uniqueâ€”beyond** what is typically covered in web courses they can access at home.


Currently, my friends and I are developing a educational (simple yet sufficient) dependent typed language based on [Pie-lang](https://thelittletyper.com). We are developing this as a extension of the [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/playground), a widely used platform of teaching for courses like *Programming Methodolody(CS1101S)* for now.
