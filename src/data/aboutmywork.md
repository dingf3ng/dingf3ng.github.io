## Basic Coursework

I am a third-year Computer Science major at the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a minor in Mathematics. Over the past two years, I have completed extensive coursework in programming languages, a field where I have cultivated a deep academic interest.

## Academic Focus

My curiosity is driven by a well-known rule of thumb:

> programmers spend about 80% of their time debugging.

Motivated by this reality, I explore innovations in programming languages and frameworks to enhance developer productivity.

Currently, my primary focus is the design and implementation of both general-purpose and domain-specific languages.
I have contributed to two published projects in this area and am developing several side projects for future public release.
I view innovations in programming paradigms as powerful tools for augmenting communication between humans and machines, as well as among machines themselves. 
In the age of AI, enabling more expressive, efficient, and natural interaction between people and computing systems is a frontier I am eager to explore.

Recently, I have also expanded into program specification and analysis.
I view this as a necessary complement to my previous work: while better language design reduces the frequency of errors, better specification and analysis tools ensure that inevitable errors are detected and resolved efficiently.

## Teaching Experience

Parallel to my research, I am actively involved in education at NUS as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the following modules:

* CS1231S – Discrete Mathematics, AY24/25 Semester 1
* CS2040S – Data Structures and Algorithms, AY24/25 Semester 2
* CS2040S – Data Structures and Algorithms, AY25/26 Semester 2

While discrete mathematics and algorithms may seem distinct from programming languages, they are deeply interconnected. Writing Proofs is, in essence, writing programs; algorithms and data structures rely on rigorous proofs to guarantee correctness. 

Students often perceive these courses as overly abstract. In my experience, this disconnect stems from a lack of visibility into why these concepts matter in real-world development. Bridging this gap is crucial.

At present, I am also exploring ways to integrate modern programming language concepts into introductory computer science courses to help students build a deeper, more connected understanding of what they are doing daily — ***programming*** — both as an art and a science.
