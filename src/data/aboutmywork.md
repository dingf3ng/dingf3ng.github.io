## Basic Coursework

I am a Year 3 student at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
Over the past two years, I have taken several modules related to programming languages, a field in which I have developed deep academic interest.

## Academic Focus

My curiosity is driven by a well-known rule of thumb:

> programmers spend about 80% of their time debugging.

Under this assumption, I am exploring the various possibilities in programming languages, to enhance the productivity by introducing innovations in programming languages and frameworks.

Currently, my primary focus lies in the design and implementation of programming languages, including both general-purpose and domain-specific languages (DSLs). 
I have been involved in two published major projects in this area, alongside several smaller side projects that I intend to release publicly once they reach a more mature stage. 
I believe that domain-specific languages along new programming paradigms can serve as powerful tools for communication — not only between humans and machines, but also between machines themselves. In the age of AI, enabling people and intelligent systems to communicate in more expressive, efficient, and comfortable ways through language innovation is an exciting frontier.

Recently, I have also begun exploring the field of program specification and analysis, an area that can be seen as the dual or the complement of the previous one.
Here is the reason: while better language design reduces the likelihood of errors, better specification and analysis techniques make it easier to detect and fix them when they inevitably occur.

## Teaching Experience

In parallel with my research interests, I have been actively involved in teaching at NUS.
I have served as a undergraduate teaching assistant for the following modules:

* CS1231S – Discrete Mathematics, AY24/25 Semester 1, Tutorial Group 08A
* CS2040S – Data Structures and Algorithms, AY24/25 Semester 2, Tutorial Group 34
* CS2040S – Data Structures and Algorithms, AY25/26 Semester 2, N/A

Although discrete mathematics and algorithms may seem disconnected from programming languages at first glance, they are actually deeply related.
Proofs are, in essence, programs; algorithms and data structures rely on rigorous proofs to guarantee correctness.
These theoretical foundations are essential for understanding the very principles that underpin programming language design, and in a broader sense, computational thinking.

However, many students perceive these courses as overly abstract or "impractical". 
From my experience, this stems from a lack of understanding of *why* these concepts matter and how they connect to real-world programming. Bridging this gap between theory and practice is crucial.

One promising way to achieve this is by introducing programming languages and paradigms designed for education. Such languages can make abstract concepts — for example, *continuations* or the *Curry–Howard Correspondence* — more intuitive and relatable, helping students appreciate the elegance behind programming theory.

At present, I am exploring ways to integrate modern programming language concepts into introductory computer science courses to help students build a deeper, more connected understanding of what they are doing daily — ***programming*** — both as an art and a science.
