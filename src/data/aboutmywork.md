### Basic Coursework

I am a year 3 student at *School of Computing* in NUS. And I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics (almost finished), and Economics (not yet start).

### My academic focus

Currently I am exploring the possibilities in the field of programming language, and its implications with logic. I am particularly interested in enhancing the productivity by introducing innovations in programming language designs.

The disconnect between theoretical computer science concepts and practical programming creates significant challenges for students and professionals alike. While concepts like *types, continuations, recursion, and formal logic* serve as the essential foundation of programming, many struggle to see their relevance in everyday coding tasks. When learners fail to grasp these fundamental theoretical concepts, problems that seem minor in introductory courses can evolve into significant roadblocks during advanced studies or professional work. For example, understanding type theory becomes crucial when working with complex type systems in languages like Haskell or simply to understand everyday languages like Java better.

I am serving as a Teaching Assistant for *Discrete Mathematics (CS1231S)* and *Data Structures & Algorithms (CS2040S)* in School of Computing, NUS. From my observations, many students struggle to understand why they are learning these theoretical concepts, often dismissing them as "nonsense". This lack of understanding is dangerous, as, in my opinion, the first and most crucial step in learning is **to know why** the subject is important and **what does it have to do** practical applications in ones future careers.

Thankfully, there is hope for bridging this gap by introducing distinct programming languages into the current curriculum. This concept may help students grasp the crucialness of concepts like the *delimited-continuations* and *Curry-Howard Correspondence*, resolving their "why-confusions" and fostering a deeper appreciation for theoretical foundations.

So for now, I am particularly interested in integrating advances in programming languages into introductory courses to provide students with a more profound and beautiful understanding of programming. **They deserve the right to learn something uniqueâ€”beyond what is typically covered in web courses they can access at home**.

Currently, I am involved in developing some educational (simple yet sufficient) programming languages. One of them is based on [Pie](https://thelittletyper.com). We are developing this as a extension of the [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/playground), a widely used platform of teaching for courses like *Programming Methodolody(CS1101S)* as of now. The other explores the *duality*, and can be a great advance in understanding concepts related to continuations. Please see details in my resume.
