# Reflections on Teaching: Academic Year 24/25

## Overview

It was my first experience as a teaching assistant this past academic year, supporting *Discrete Structures (CS1231S)* in the first semester and *Data Structures and Algorithms (CS2040S)* in the second.

Teaching represents more than knowledge transmission—it's a profound journey of shaping minds and fostering intellectual growth. Thoughtful reflection on this experience is not merely beneficial but essential to an educator's responsibility. In this report, I'll examine the curriculum structure, identify common student challenges, and evaluate my pedagogical approaches and their effectiveness.

## The Curricula

### Part I, on Discrete Structures

#### Syllabus

#### My Comments

While the teaching quality for this first-semester module was generally strong, I identified a significant disconnect between the abstract mathematical content and practical programming applications. This gap caused many students—myself included when I took the course—to misperceive the module as merely an "IQ test" rather than recognizing the profound beauty of logic and proofs and their direct relevance to programming practice. This misconception prevents students from developing the logical foundations needed for writing precise, accurate code in their future academic and professional endeavors.

Although I introduced supplementary programming-related examples during tutorials, the tight time constraints limited my ability to present these connections comprehensively. Additionally, while the examinations were appropriately challenging, their deliberately complex design sometimes obscured the intrinsic difficulty of the core concepts. A more content-focused approach to assessment might help dispel the module's reputation as merely a means of student differentiation.

I recommend that the teaching team revise the curriculum to emphasize computer science applications more explicitly, helping students connect abstract mathematical concepts with practical programming scenarios. This approach would not only improve content retention but also broaden students' perspectives and strengthen their motivation by demonstrating the immediate relevance of discrete mathematics to their chosen field.

### Part II, on DS&A

#### Syllabus

1) Introduction (incl. Java OOP)
2) Searching (incl. Peak Finding)
3) Sorting (incl. Selection, Bubble, Insertion, & Merge)
4) QuickSort (incl. Paranoid QuickSort, & QuickSelect)
5) Trees (incl. Binary Search Trees, & AVL Trees)

8) Graphs (incl. Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, & Directed Acyclic Graphs)
9) Single Source Shortest Path (incl. Dijkstra & Bellman-Ford)
10) Union-Find (incl. Kruskal's)
11) Minimum Spanning Tree (incl. Prim's)
12) Dynamic Programming (incl. Floyd-Warshall's)

#### My Comments

The module covers an extensive range of fundamental data structures and algorithms, necessitating a rapid instructional pace. While the course materials—slides and tutorial sheets—maintain high quality overall, certain problems present excessive complexity that exceeds the realistic absorption capacity of our student demographic. Given that many students enter the university without competitive programming experience, these particularly intricate questions demand both theoretical understanding and practical coding experience that many haven't yet developed.

I recommend recalibrating these advanced problems toward more foundational exercises that strengthen core concepts (such as identify the invariant of algorithms or data structures). This approach would better prepare students for subsequent coursework while reducing the emphasis on solving isolated difficult problems. Such a recalibration would align the module more effectively with students' developmental trajectory in algorithmic thinking and programming proficiency, ensuring a more accessible yet thorough learning experience.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### What Are the Challenges

- **Diverse Learning Needs**: Due to significant variation in student backgrounds, the learning needs across the class remain remarkably diverse. Some students require intensive support on particular topics, especially those encountering these concepts for the first time. Conversely, students with established foundations—particularly those with prior programming experience—need minimal guidance but benefit substantially from prompt, targeted feedback on their work. This spectrum of preparedness necessitates a flexible teaching approach that can accommodate varying levels of understanding while ensuring all students continue to progress appropriately through the curriculum.

- **Interactive Learning**: The 2-hour tutorial sessions present a significant challenge for maintaining student attention and participation. Without sufficient interactivity, students commonly experience fatigue and diminishing focus as the session progresses, compromising the effectiveness of the latter portion of these extended meetings.

- **Real-world Applications**: The modules struggle to effectively bridge abstract theoretical concepts with real-world applications, creating unnecessary barriers to student comprehension and diminishing motivation. This disconnect leads students to grapple with seemingly isolated mathematical and algorithmic principles without understanding their practical significance. When students cannot envision how these concepts manifest in actual software development or problem-solving scenarios, they often resort to rote memorization rather than developing genuine understanding.

- **Lack of Assessment**: As a teaching assistant, I found the existing assessment methods merely enough for gauging student progress. This deficiency makes timely evaluation of students' abilities and learning outcomes particularly challenging. This assessment limitation further compounds the already complex task of addressing diverse learning needs and creating truly interactive learning experiences.

### What Are the Solutions

- **On Diverse Learning Needs**: Implementing differentiated instruction to accommodate various learning styles and make the teaching method to be more flexible. Also be accessible after class so that individuals can get help at their own pace.

- **On Interactive Learning**: Engaging students in discussions and hands-on activities promotes deeper understanding and retention. However, this approach creates a time-management dilemma that potentially extends class duration beyond scheduled limits. This challenge directly intersects with our diverse learning needs problem—students with strong prior knowledge might view extended activities as inefficient, while those newer to the concepts often find these interactive elements essential for comprehension. Finding the right balance requires careful activity structuring, differentiated learning paths, and ongoing assessment of student preferences to ensure that engagement strategies serve all students effectively without unnecessarily prolonging sessions.
  - possible solutions:
    1) Creating optional pre-tutorial engagement activities for interested students.
    2) Carefully structuring activities with clear time boundaries to prevent unplanned extensions.
    3) Collecting anonymous feedback specifically about time utilization to gauge student satisfaction.

- **On Real-world Applications**: Introduce brief case studies showing real-world applications of each theoretical concept. Incorporate programming demonstrations that directly implement the mathematical concepts. Introduce optional mini-projects where students apply course concepts to solve practical problems

- **On Lack of Assessment**: Introduce weekly low-stakes in-class quizzes to gauge ongoing comprehension. Implement a digital feedback system where students can indicate concepts they find unclear. Try to create self-assessment tools for students to evaluate their own understanding

## Personal Growth as an Educator

Teaching has been a journey of growth, not just for my students but also for me. Each semester has offered fresh insights into effective communication, content mastery, and the art of explanation. I have come to see mistakes—both mine and my students'—as valuable opportunities for learning.

Here are some of the skills I have developed through my teaching experience:

- **Enhanced Communication Skills:** As a non-native English speaker, I have significantly improved my proficiency in English and my ability to communicate effectively.
- **Deepened Subject Mastery:** Regularly reviewing course materials has allowed me to develop new perspectives and a deeper understanding of the content.
- **Improved Student Assessment:** I have honed my ability to assess student progress accurately and provide tailored support based on their individual needs.

## The Impact of Mentorship

The most rewarding aspect of teaching lies in the mentor-mentee relationships formed. Watching students evolve from uncertain beginners to confident practitioners reinforces the profound responsibility and privilege that comes with being an educator.

## Looking Forward

As I continue this teaching journey, I aim to:

- Inprove my English skill
- Remain curious and open to innovative pedagogical approaches
- Seek regular feedback to refine my methods
- Foster a learning environment that celebrates curiosity and critical thinking
- Maintain the delicate balance between managing my work and providing support for students

## Conclusion

Teaching is not merely a profession but a continuous dialogue between educator and learner. Through this ongoing exchange, both parties evolve, creating a dynamic relationship that transcends the confines of a classroom or curriculum.
