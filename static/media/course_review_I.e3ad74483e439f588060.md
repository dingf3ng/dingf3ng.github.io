*Note: The teaching team might vary from year to year, as does the validity of the review. The review is just my personal view.*

For each course, I will cover what it is about, and point out its uniqueness, if any. Finally rate the course
in 4 dimensions:

- Effectiveness: to what degree the course conveys its idea effectively.
- Usefulness: to what degree you will benefit from the course.
- Importance: to what degree you need to spend your MCs on the course.
- Workload: how many time you need to spend on the course to gain a decent grade, on average.

In this part of the course review, I will discuss some classic CS courses (including the infamous Trinity), and three core math mods.

## CS1231S - Discrete Structures

Teaching team: *Prof. Aaron Tan* et al.

This module serves as a foundational introduction to discrete mathematics, covering essential concepts for computer science undergraduates. The syllabus encompasses mathematical logic, set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory, all of which are critical for advanced studies in the field.

The course administration is highly effective and responsive, with feedback on exams and homework typically provided within a week. While the administrative aspects are commendable, the course content appears to have remained static over the years. A modernized syllabus would significantly enhance student comprehension. The current curriculum often overlooks the practical motivations behind each concept, leaving a handful of students questioning the relevance of the material to their future studies and careers in computer science.
Integrating applications and examples would bridge this gap and better illustrate the importance of these foundational topics.

## CS2030S - Programming Methodology II

Teaching team: *Prof. Adi Yoga S. Prabawa* et al.

This module provides a critical introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP), covering key concepts such as polymorphism, method binding, sub-typing, monads, and laziness, using *Java*. These principles are valuable for both software engineering careers and academic research.

While the module offers a solid introduction, the theoretical aspects of functional programming are not explored in depth, which is understandable for a nature of foundational course.
For a more comprehensive theoretical understanding, students may consider taking *CS3234 - Logic for Proofs and Programs*
as a complement.
Professor Adi effectively conveys the core concepts of the syllabus. However, there are administrative delays, particularly with feedback on assignments and exams. Additional support for the teaching staff could help improve the course's administrative efficiency.

The primary workload consists of weekly labs, which can vary significantly in time commitment, varies from 1-2 hours to 10+ hours. Beyond the labs, there are few other compulsory tasks.
things to do.
Notably, Practical Exams can be disastrous if you are not a good typer or not familiar with Vim code editor, however, to minimize the effect of the disaster, please ensure that your code COMPILES before the exam concludes.

## CS2040S - Data Structures and Algorithms

Teaching team: *Prof. Seth Gilbert, Prof. Shao Lin* et al.

This course covers the most classic data structures and algorithms, with the help of *Java* - same as CS2030S.
The content includes various sorts, various selections, various searches, trees, graphs and heaps. Yes it contains a lot of content and is arguably one of the most content-heavy course in NUS.

The course introduces its concepts by multiple ways, there are 3-hour lectures, 2-hour tutorials, 1-hour recitations per week. Plus, *in principle*, you need to spend at least 2 hours in doing weekly tutorial sheets consider its non-trivial difficulty, and at least 1 hour in preparing recitation sheets, and many hours on semi-biweekly problem sets (could cost 1 - 10 hours, depends on your familiarity to the algorithms and the Java language). So an in-principle estimation of weekly workload could be 15 hours on average.

Content-wise, the module is useful, in tech interviews or in further studies. And one should try to do their best, to understand the concepts, to help them to go further. The questions in tutorials and exams can appear to be very hard, which need great techniques to solve. This is weird for an introductory course, since it could potentially be a harm to students' real understanding to the concept and let students focus to much on the problem-solving techniques.

In term of teaching, both prof. Seth and prof. Shao Lin are decent lecturers. They were trying to make the content not as dry as they originally is. The course is basically administrated well, although the timely-ness of the feedback is heavily depends on your TA, and mine is very good.

One thing to be aware of is that the grading scheme is hidden, which means you should try to excel in every component of the course.

## CS2100 - Computer Organization

Teaching team: *Prof. Aaron Tan, Prof. Prabhu Natarajan* et al.

This could be the most boring and dry CS course I have taken. Take it, if possible, on your exchange or summer school.

Its contents, including assembly analysis and caches are crucially useful, but the way they are covered is really, really terrible - and it gets more terrible considering how important these contents are.
The lectures are all pre-recorded and totally lack of interactivity and attractiveness, as same as those free course-ware you can find on Youtube, or probably worse.
The course materials is so old that some of the pictures on the lab sheets come from Windows 7.
The tutorials and labs are very boring where you need to act like a computer, and calculate things.
The exams is even more a disaster: you need to count how many clocks the pipeline help you to save, using different branch prediction strategies; you need to count how many cache hits/misses there is in a possibly triple loop written in MIPS assembly.

In one sentence, you need to know how computer works without any abstraction layer, and work as a computer throughout the course. If I can work in this way so well, what is the purpose to own a computer?

## MA1521 - Calculus for Computing

Teaching team: *Prof. To Wing Keung* et al.

This course provides a standard introduction to calculus, covering the fundamental concepts. Despite its name, the module has limited connection to computing.

The grading is heavily weighted towards the final exam, which may result in a steep bell curve (unconfirmed). For most students, this course serves as a gentle academic warm-up but no else.
While it is a required module, some may find its content inapplicable to their primary field of study.

## MA1522 - Linear Algebra for Computing

Teaching team: *Dr. Jonathan Teo*

The course is not a very standard linear algebra course, and is significantly more relevant to computing as its name
suggested. It has a heavy dependency on Matlab (you can use python if you like, as an alternative), especially in exams.

The teaching and the management is basically cool, Dr. Jonathan nailed at how to conduct a attractive lesson.
And be rest assured if your exam marks is not good, since Dr. Jonathan is prone to set hard and indirect questions.
Although this might not be the best way to test students' understanding.

Good introductory course to linear algebra, and it is very practical compare to an average math module.

## ST2334 - Probability and Statistics

Teaching team: *Prof. Yu Tao* et al.

This course combines two modules: ST2131 - Probability and ST2132 - Statistics, and it shrinks in both way naturally.
Go take ST2131 and ST2132 instead, if the topic is really relevant with your personal interest.
The curriculum is basically classical probability, combinatorics, distributions and sample tests, making it a standard
module in this topic.

The teaching is generally good. Prof. Yu is approachable and he actively minimizes the disturbance of grades on students -
by not releasing any statistics and give as much free marks as possible - to let people focus on learning but not competition. My TA, Ms. Wong Yean Ling is also responsible and approachable.

To conclude, the module is not too useful if it does not align with your interest, and not at all useful if it does.
