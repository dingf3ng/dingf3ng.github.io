*Note: The teaching team might vary from year to year, as does the validity of the review. The review is just my personal view.*

For each course, I will cover what it is about, and point out its uniqueness, if any. Finally rate the course
in 4 dimensions:

- Effectiveness: to what degree the course conveys its idea effectively.
- Usefulness: to what degree you will benefit from the course.
- Importance: to what degree you need to spend your MCs on the course.
- Workload: how many time you need to spend on the course to gain a decent grade, on average.

In this part of course review, I will review some more core modules of CS curriculum.
