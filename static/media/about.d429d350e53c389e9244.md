### Autobiography in One Paragraph

Born in Tianjin, China, I was raised in a nurturing family environment that provided me with a strong foundation.
My early years were enriched by time spent both in Tianjin and, occasionally, in Linzi (the capital of [Qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(state))), a small town in Shandong where my father was born.
My "academic" journey began at age six, following the standard educational timeline in China.
Since then, I have completed studies in my beautiful [elementary school](https://baike.baidu.com/item/天津市南开区科技实验小学/7850747), [junior high](https://baike.baidu.com/item/天津市第二十五中学/6441189) (where I luckily met my girlfriend) and [high school](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-sg/天津市新华中学).
Throughout these educational stages, I was fortunate to develop meaningful relationships with educators and peers who contributed significantly to my  personal growth.
In the year of 2023, I started my journey in Singapore, a disciplined city state.
I have been a student in School of Computing of National University of Singapore and have been keeping explore new possibilities since then.

### What I Like To Do

Born into an artistic family, I inherited a natural inclination toward creative expression.
Music serves as both a passion and relaxation method in my life. 
I can play guitar, keyboard, harmonica at amateur level, and sing during leisure hours.
My girlfriend is a music lover too, she can play piano very well and she also like to sing. As a result, singing is a common activity when we are together.
I am very happy to admit that  my perspective and even life track are significantly influenced by serveral musical works and artists.

While not an sports enthusiast, I engage in sport activities regularly.
Football has been my most-played sport since childhood, beginning around age 7~8.
This interest developed through my father's enthusiasm for the sport, and was further cultivated by the fever during the World Cup 2014.
My football experience includes representing Nankai district on a competitive team during elementary school and later playing for my high school team in mutiple leagues.
These experiences have fostered valuable spirits and friendships and continue to influence my life. I am also engaging in tennis as a developing skill, and occasionally enjoy swimming and cycling for recreation, though I acknowledge my proficiency in these activities is still evolving.

Computer gaming constituted a significant interest during earlier periods of my life. Several titles have either shaped my views or have provided substantial enjoyment for me, or both. 
This is also partly the reason  why I am studying computer science now.

Photography represents another occasional creative outlet, one that I pursue opportunistically rather than systematically.
Some of my more successful photographic works will hopefully be available in [Gallery](https://dingf3ng.github.io/#/gallery).
