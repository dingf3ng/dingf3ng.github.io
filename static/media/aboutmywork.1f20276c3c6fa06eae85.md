### My academic focus

Currently I am exploring the possibilities in the field of Programming Language Theory, and their implications with *Formal Logic*.

I am serving as a Teaching Assistant for *Discrete Mathematics (CS1231S)* and *Data Structures & Algorithms (CS2040S)* in School of Computing, NUS. By my observation, most of the students have no I idea of *why* they are learning these *"theoritical nonsense"*. This phenomenon is dangrous as, in my opinion, the first step as well as the most crucial step when learning something is **to know why** I should learn it and **what does it have to do** with those things that will be heavily used in my career. Currently the confusion is induced by lack of interaction between the *Discrete Mathematics* course and the *Introduction to Programming* course.

Thankfully, we can mitigate this tension by introducing dependent typed languages, or theorem provers. Student could learn some Curry-Howard Correspondence, and hence resolve those **"why-confusions"** in their mind. So, for now I am especially interested in merging the advances of dependent typed languages into the teaching in these introductory courses.

My objective is to let CS students have a deeper and more beautiful understanding of what they are studying, namely, programming. They **have the right to learn something different** about programming from the content of those *web courses* that they can watch anytime at home.
