### Intro

Born in Tianjin, China, I was raised in a nurturing family environment that provided me with a strong foundation. My formative years were enriched by time spent both in Tianjin and occasionally in Linzi, a small town in Shandong Province where my father was born. My academic journey began at age six, following the standard educational timeline in China. Since then, I have completed studies in my [elementary school](https://baike.baidu.com/item/天津市南开区科技实验小学/7850747), [junior high](https://baike.baidu.com/item/天津市第二十五中学/6441189) and [high school](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-sg/天津市新华中学). Throughout these educational stages, I was fortunate to develop meaningful relationships with educators and peers who contributed significantly to my intellectual and personal growth.

In the year of 2023, I started my journey in Singapore, a vibrant and disciplined city state. I have been a student in *School of Computing* of NUS and have been keeping explore new possibilities since then.

### What I like

Born into an artistic family, I inherited a natural inclination toward creative expression. Music serves as both a passion and relaxation method in my life—I play guitar, keyboard, harmonica, and sing during leisure hours. Various musical compositions and artists have significantly influenced my perspective and creative process.

While not an avid sports enthusiast, I engage in several athletic activities regularly. Football has been my primary sport since childhood, beginning around age 7-8. This interest developed through my father's enthusiasm for the game and was further cultivated during the World Cup 2014. My football experience includes representing Nankai District on a competitive team during elementary school and later playing for my high school team. These experiences have fostered valuable friendships and continue to enrich my life.

I engage in tennis as a developing skill, and occasionally enjoy swimming and running for recreation, though I acknowledge my proficiency in these activities is still evolving.

Gaming constituted a significant interest during earlier periods of my life. Several titles have either shaped my perspectives or provided substantial enjoyment.

Photography represents another occasional creative outlet, one that I pursue opportunistically rather than systematically. Some of my more successful photographic works will be available in [Gallery](https://dingf3ng.github.io/gallery).
