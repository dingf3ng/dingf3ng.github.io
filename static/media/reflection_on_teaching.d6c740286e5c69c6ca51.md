# Reflections on Teaching: Academic Year 24/25

## Overview

It was the first time that, I took the position of teaching assistant in the past academic year. I was teaching the modules *Discrete Structures (CS1231S)* in the first semester and *Data Structure and Algorithms (CS2040S)* in the second semester.

Teaching is a profound journey that extends beyond imparting knowledge to shaping minds and fostering growth, and hence to have a thorough reflection should be recongnized as a part of the educator's responsibility. In this report, I will discuss the curriculum, the common problems among students, and finally my deeds.

## The Dynamic Classroom Environment

Every classroom is a unique ecosystem, composed of diverse individuals with varying learning styles, backgrounds, and aspirations. Navigating this diversity requires adaptability and a commitment to creating an inclusive space where all students feel valued and capable of success.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### What Works

- **Interactive Learning**: Engaging students in discussions and hands-on activities promotes deeper understanding and retention.
- **Real-world Applications**: Connecting theoretical concepts to practical scenarios enhances relevance and student interest.
- **Formative Assessment**: Regular feedback loops help adjust teaching strategies and identify areas where students need additional support.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Diverse Learning Needs**: Implementing differentiated instruction to accommodate various learning styles.
- **Technology Integration**: Balancing digital tools with traditional methods to enhance rather than distract from learning.
- **Student Engagement**: Developing creative approaches to maintain interest and motivation.

## Personal Growth as an Educator

Teaching has been as much about my growth as it has been about student development. Each semester brings new insights into effective communication, patience, and the art of explanation. I've learned to value mistakes—both mine and my students'—as opportunities for learning.

## The Impact of Mentorship

The most rewarding aspect of teaching lies in the mentor-mentee relationships formed. Watching students evolve from uncertain beginners to confident practitioners reinforces the profound responsibility and privilege that comes with being an educator.

## Looking Forward

As I continue this teaching journey, I aim to:

- Remain curious and open to innovative pedagogical approaches
- Seek regular feedback to refine my methods
- Foster a learning environment that celebrates curiosity and critical thinking
- Maintain the delicate balance between challenging students and providing support

## Conclusion

Teaching is not merely a profession but a continuous dialogue between educator and learner. Through this ongoing exchange, both parties evolve, creating a dynamic relationship that transcends the confines of a classroom or curriculum.
